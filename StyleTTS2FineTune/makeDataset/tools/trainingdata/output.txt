sample2_0.wav|There's something powerful about simply showing up.|1
sample2_1.wav|On the days when it is hot, on the days when your energy is low, or on the days when you don't feel ready, but you try anyway.|1
sample2_4.wav|Even if no one sees, even if no one says thank you, your strength doesn't always look like power or speed.|1
sample2_6.wav|It looks like standing still.|1
sample2_7.wav|Sometimes, it looks like saying, this is hard, but I'm here.|1
sample2_8.wav|You often think strength means never breaking, but real strength is tougher than that.|1
sample2_9.wav|Real strength says, we've been broken before, and I came back.|1
sample2_10.wav|It says, I still feel fear, but I've moved anyway.|1
sample2_11.wav|It says, I'm not perfect, but I'm still worth it.|1
sample2_12.wav|You don't have to be unshakable to be strong.|1
sample2_13.wav|You just have to be honest.|1
sample2_14.wav|You just have to keep choosing hope.|1
sample2_15.wav|And hope isn't always loud.|1
sample2_16.wav|It doesn't always look like bright lines or bold plans.|1
sample2_17.wav|Sometimes hope is wired, a whisper in the back of your mind that says, keep going.|1
sample2_18.wav|A small voice that says, try again tomorrow.|1
sample2_19.wav|And when you listen to that voice, when you choose to believe in something better, even a little bit, that's a victory.|1
sample2_20.wav|There's a calm kind of courage in choosing to love your life, even when it's messy, in choosing to trust the path.|1
sample2_21.wav|even when it's foggy, in choosing to stay open even after being hurt.|1
sample2_23.wav|And sometimes, if good ahead doesn't come from the big achievements, sometimes it comes from the tiniest moments.|1
sample2_25.wav|Even in your quietest seasons, there's something blooming.|1
sample2_26.wav|Even when nothing feels certain, you're still growing.|1
sample2_27.wav|You're still learning how to take care of yourself.|1
sample2_28.wav|How to say no to what drains you.|1
sample2_29.wav|How to say yes to what fuels you.|1
sample2_32.wav|And you deserve to be proud of that.|1
sample2_33.wav|You don't have to prove anything.|1
sample2_34.wav|Not your words, not your pace, not your dreams.|1
sample2_36.wav|You get to write it in your own way, your own time.|1
sample2_37.wav|And if today's chapter feels heavy, that's okay.|1
sample2_38.wav|Some stories take longer to unfold.|1
sample2_39.wav|Some pages are slower but still beautiful.|1
sample2_40.wav|So give yourself patience.|1
sample2_41.wav|Give yourself kindness.|1
sample2_42.wav|Let go of the pressures to always be on.|1
sample2_43.wav|You are allowed to rest.|1
sample2_45.wav|And you are allowed to simply be without needing to earn your place.|1
sample2_47.wav|You are not a person living, breathing, feeling person.|1
sample2_48.wav|You are not here to be perfect.|1
sample2_50.wav|And real means feeling deeply.|1
sample2_51.wav|It means become brave enough to care, to hope, to love, even when it is risky, even when it is hard.|1
sample2_52.wav|And when you look back someday, you won't remember every detail.|1
sample2_53.wav|You won't remember every task you completed or every goal you reached, but you will remember how you felt.|1
sample1_0.wav|Sometimes, it's good to just sit down and breathe, really breathe.|1
sample1_1.wav|Not the kind of breathing we do without thinking, but slow, deep breaths that remind us we're alive.|1
sample1_2.wav|The world moves so fast, people rushing from one thing to the next, phones buzzing, notifications popping up, tasks peeling higher and higher.|1
sample1_3.wav|And in the middle of all that noise, we can forget what it feels like to just stop|1
sample1_4.wav|to pause and to look around notice things.|1
sample1_5.wav|The sky, the wind, the way sunlight filters through the leaves of a tree.|1
sample1_6.wav|These little things, they may seem small, but they don't matter.|1
sample1_7.wav|They bring us back to our self.|1
sample1_8.wav|I think about life a lot, about how strange and wonderful it is to wake up every day and have a chance to do something new.|1
sample1_9.wav|We don't always think of it that way.|1
sample1_10.wav|We wake up, check our phones, start our routines and go through the motions.|1
sample1_11.wav|But when you really think about it, each day is a blank page, and you get to decide what to write on it.|1
sample1_12.wav|Maybe it's just a wild day, maybe it's exciting, it's difficult, but it's yours.|1
sample1_13.wav|No one else is living in your life.|1
sample1_14.wav|No one else has your exact feelings, your unique stories.|1
sample1_15.wav|We all carry things like memories, dreams, worries, hopes.|1
sample1_16.wav|Some of them we share, some of them we keep tucked away.|1
sample1_18.wav|Being human means having layers.|1
sample1_19.wav|There are parts of us we show to the world and parts we don't.|1
sample1_20.wav|But all of those parts belong.|1
sample1_21.wav|They make us who we are.|1
sample1_22.wav|And there is no need to rush to fix everything or being perfect.|1
sample1_23.wav|You are allowed to take your time.|1
sample1_24.wav|You are allowed to grow slowly.|1
sample1_25.wav|In fact, some of the most beautiful things in life take time.|1
sample1_26.wav|Trees don't grow overnight.|1
sample1_27.wav|Rivers don't care bad in those instant.|1
sample1_28.wav|And people, real, growing feeling people take time too.|1
sample1_29.wav|When I look back on moments that truly mattered, it's not the big flashy things that come to mind.|1
sample1_31.wav|A kind word from a friend, laughing with someone late at night, sitting in the silence with someone and feeling safe.|1
sample1_32.wav|These moments don't make headlines, but they make a life.|1
sample1_33.wav|They remind us that connection is what we really need to be seen, to be heard, to know that we are not alone.|1
sample1_34.wav|It's easy to forget that, especially when everything around us tells us to do more, be more, achieve more.|1
sample1_35.wav|But sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is slow down, to say, oh, this is enough for today, to give yourself permission to rest.|1
sample1_36.wav|Remember, rest isn't laziness, it's healing, it's recovery, it's listening to what your mind and your body need.|1
sample1_37.wav|When you rest, when you pause, you create your old base for new ideas, for refresh your energy, and for peace.|1
sample1_38.wav|I also think it is important to remember that no one has it all figured out.|1
sample1_39.wav|We see people online or in real life too who seem confident, successful, happy, but everyone is carrying something.|1
sample1_40.wav|Everyone has doubts, fears, struggles, but they don't always talk about it.|1
sample1_41.wav|That's what makes kindness so important.|1
sample1_42.wav|You never know what someone is going through.|1
sample1_43.wav|So a small gesture, like holding a jaw, offering a smile, say how are you really, can mean more than you know.|1
sample1_44.wav|And kindness isn't just for others, it's for ourselves too.|1
sample1_45.wav|Talk to yourself is the way that you would talk to someone you love, being patient with your own journey.|1
sample1_46.wav|You might not be where you want to be need, but that doesn't mean you are lost.|1
sample1_47.wav|You just mean you are still moving, still learning, and every step you take, no matter how small, it matters.|1
sample1_48.wav|Sometimes we look at the future and feel scared, but there are so many unknowns, so many things we can control.|1
sample1_50.wav|Life isn't always easy, but it is full of chances to begin again.|1
sample1_51.wav|Every sunrise reminds that you made it through the night, and that alone is worth celebrating.|1
sample1_53.wav|And if you ever feel like you are not doing enough, remember this.|1
sample1_54.wav|Simply being here matters.|1
sample1_56.wav|You don't have to earn your worth.|1
sample1_58.wav|You were born with it.|1
sample1_59.wav|And no mistake, no failure, no heartache can take away.|1
sample1_60.wav|So, just take your time.|1
sample1_62.wav|Listen, feel, laugh when you can, cry when you need.|1
sample1_64.wav|This journey, your journey, is not about being perfect.|1
sample1_65.wav|It's about being present, showing up, being honest with yourself, and giving yourself a grace to grow at your own pace.|1
sample1_66.wav|And when you feel lost, look for the little things, quiet signs, the gentle reminder that you are okay, that you have made it this far.|1
sample1_67.wav|And that day is still so much ahead.|1
sample1_68.wav|So much love, so much learning, and so much light.|1
sample1_70.wav|You don't have to know everything.|1
sample1_71.wav|Just keep moving, step by step, breath by breath.|1
sample1_72.wav|You are doing better than you think.|1
sample1_73.wav|And you are never as alone as you feel.|1
sample1_74.wav|There will be days when you don't feel like yourself, days when you wake up and some things fill up, even if you can't explain why.|1
sample1_75.wav|Maybe your body feels tired, maybe your heart feels heavy, or maybe your mind just won't slow down.|1
sample1_77.wav|Those days don't mean you're failing, they just mean you're human, and humans aren't meant to feel great all the time.|1
sample1_78.wav|We are not machines, we feel, we break, we rest, we heal.|1
sample1_79.wav|And then, little by little, we come back to the life.|1
sample1_80.wav|You don't have to force yourself to be okay.|1
sample1_81.wav|Sometimes the strongest thing you can do is admit that you are not okay and give yourself space to sit with that.|1
sample1_83.wav|Let the truth move through.|1
sample1_84.wav|And you don't have to solve everything today.|1
sample1_85.wav|You just have to be honest and gentle and kind.|1
sample1_86.wav|Kindness is a wild kind of power.|1
sample1_88.wav|It doesn't try to be the loudest in the room.|1
sample1_90.wav|It makes people feel seen.|1
sample1_91.wav|And when you're giving kindness to others,|1
sample1_94.wav|It's just you, the really you.|1
sample1_95.wav|The one who laughs at silly things, the one who gets nervous sometimes, the one who has dreams, fears, and stories that no one else knows.|1
sample1_96.wav|That version of you is more than enough.|1
sample1_97.wav|That version of you is worth loving and just as you are.|1
sample1_98.wav|And if you're trying hard lately, trying to fix things, trying to hold it all together, I want to remind you that it's okay to rest.|1
sample1_99.wav|It's okay to stop and say, yeah, I'm doing my best now.|1
sample1_101.wav|Even on the days when you feel like you're falling behind, even on the days when progress is slow, your effort matters.|1
sample1_103.wav|We have to be smarter, be faster, and being better every day.|1
sample1_104.wav|But what if we turn that voice down for a while?|1
sample1_105.wav|What if we ask instead, am I being kind?|1
sample1_106.wav|Am I listening to my body?|1
sample1_107.wav|Or am I treating myself with love?|1
sample1_108.wav|Because at the end of the day, those are the things that really matter.|1
sample1_109.wav|the way we treat ourselves, the way we show up for others, the way we can carry hope, even when life feels uncertain.|1
sample1_110.wav|And life is uncertain.|1
sample1_111.wav|That's one of the only things we can count on.|1
sample1_115.wav|But that's not always a bad thing.|1
sample1_116.wav|Change means growth.|1
sample1_117.wav|It means new chances.|1
sample1_118.wav|We mean life is still moving, still unfolding.|1
sample1_120.wav|Sometimes it hurts, but sometimes it brings forth beautiful surprises.|1
sample1_121.wav|Think of how many things you once feared and you now overcome.|1
sample1_122.wav|Think of how many things you have learned without even realizing you are wiser now than you were a year ago.|1
sample1_123.wav|You're grown in the ways you may not even see.|1
sample1_125.wav|Celebrate the wild winds.|1
sample1_126.wav|Celebrate how far you have come, even if you still have far to go.|1
sample1_127.wav|It is okay to have the answers.|1
sample1_128.wav|Is it okay to say, I don't know?|1
sample1_129.wav|You don't need to know everything to move forward.|1
sample1_130.wav|You just need to enough courage and to take one more step.|1
sample1_131.wav|That's how most journeys work.|1
sample1_132.wav|One step at a time, one breath, one moment, you keep going, you keep trying, and somehow, you get stronger.|1
sample1_134.wav|These are changes we don't always see, but they matter just as much as the big ones.|1
sample1_135.wav|So, just take your time.|1
sample1_139.wav|You are simply becoming, and that is beautiful thing.|1
